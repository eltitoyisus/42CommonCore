# NetPractice

## Overview

NetPractice is a 42 school project focused on understanding networking concepts through practical exercises. The project consists of 10 progressive levels that teach fundamental networking principles including:

- **IP addressing** - Understanding IPv4 addresses and their structure
- **Subnet masks** - Learning how to divide networks into subnets
- **Network routing** - Configuring routes between different networks
- **TCP/IP networking** - Understanding how network communication works
- **Network troubleshooting** - Identifying and fixing network configuration issues

Each level presents a network diagram with missing or incorrect configurations. The goal is to fill in the correct IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing information to make the network functional. The difficulty increases progressively, starting with simple point-to-point connections and advancing to complex multi-network topologies with routers and multiple subnets.

This project helps develop essential skills for understanding how networks operate at a fundamental level, which is crucial for any software engineer or system administrator.
